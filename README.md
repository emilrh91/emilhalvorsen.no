# Emil Halvorsen's Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, experience, and academic projects. As a front-end focused software developer, I've constructed this site with a clean, responsive design that hopefully provides an enjoyable user experience.

## Project Structure

This project is built with Vue.js and is organized into several components:

- `PortfolioHome.vue`: This is the landing page of my portfolio, containing the 'About Me' component and a carousel of academic projects.

- `AboutMe.vue`: This section includes a brief introduction about me and a display of my skill set.

- `ExpandableContent.vue`: An interactive component that toggles the visibility of its content.

- `NavigationBar.vue`: This component provides site-wide navigation, featuring a responsive design.

- `ProjectCard.vue`: These cards display the details of each showcased project, including a project snapshot, title, description, and links to both the GitHub repository and the live project site.

The `assets` directory contains static files like images and icons, while the `data` directory includes JSON files containing the details of my projects.
